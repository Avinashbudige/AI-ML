# AI/ML Deep Learning Portfolio

This repository is organized as follows:

1. Data-related files are under the `data` folder.
2. Tutorial and foundational scripts are divided into separate skill-focused directories (e.g., `01_Python_Basics`, `02_Supervised_Learning`, etc.).
3. `src` contains re-usable scripts, utilities, and data handling modules.
4. Any final notebooks can be found under the `notebooks` section.
5. Reports, including figures, graphs, or other experimental documents, go under the `reports` section.
6. Tests for the entire project reside in the `tests` section.
